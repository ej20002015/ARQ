# name = "<StructName>"
#
# # The plural form of the name.
# name_plural = "<StructNamePlural>"

# # A short, unique uppercase string for identifying this type (e.g., "CPTY").
# type_string = "<TypeString>"
#
# # The corresponding table name in the database (e.g., "Counterparties").
# table_name = "<TableName>"
#
# # The member field within the struct that acts as its unique key,
# # often used for map storage (e.g., "counterpartyId").
# key = "<KeyMemberName>"
#
# # A descriptive comment for the entity itself.
# comment = "<A description of the whole entity>"
#
# # List of members for this entity.
